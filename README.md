After cloning, open `RealmTV.xcworkspace` and launch `RealmTV` onto an Apple TV running tvOS and `realmtv-ios` onto an iOS device.

## Use
Open the iOS app on your favourite second screen device and choose a talk on the Apple TV.
Once the talk starts playing you should see the transcript following the video on the iOS device.
