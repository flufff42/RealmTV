tvOS app and iOS companion for watching Realm videos on large screens

## Setup

- _**Clone**_ the repository. Due to [git-lfs#903](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/903) downloading the `ZIP` archive will not include image assets stored using [`LFS`](https://git-lfs.github.com).
- Run `git-lfs pull` to pull images from `LFS`.
- Open `RealmTV.xcworkspace` and launch `RealmTV` onto an Apple TV running tvOS and `realmtv-ios` onto an iOS device.

## Use
- Open the iOS app on your favourite second screen device and choose a talk on the Apple TV.
- Once the talk starts playing you should see the transcript following the video on the iOS device.
- From the iOS device you can also adjust the size and position of the slide overlay on the Apple TV output.
